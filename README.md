Commet is a client for [Matrix](https://matrix.org) focused on providing a feature rich experience while maintaining a simple interface. The goal is to build a secure, privacy respecting app without compromising on the features you have come to expect from a modern chat client.

# Features
- Supports **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Android** (MacOS and iOS planned in future)
- End to End Ecryption
- Custom Emoji + Stickers
- GIF Search
- Multiple Accounts
- Spaces
- Emoji verification & cross signing

# Development
Commet is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), currently v3.13.5. 

This repo currently has a monorepo structure, containing two flutter projects: Commet and Tiamat. Commet is the main client, and Tiamat is a sort of wrapper around Material with some extra goodies, which is used to maintain a consistent style across the app. Tiamat may eventually be moved to its own repo, but for now it is maintained here for ease of development.
## Building

### 1. [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

### 2. Install Libraries
Commet requires some additional libraries to be built 
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build libgtk-3-dev libolm3 libmpv-dev mpv ffmpeg libmimalloc-dev
```

### 3. Fetch Dependencies
You will need to change directory in to commet, then fetch dependencies
```bash
cd commet
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Code Generation
We make use of procedural code generation in some parts of commet. As a rule, generated code will not be checked in to git, and will need to be generated before building.

To run code generation, run the script within the `commet` directory:
`dart run scripts/codegen.dart`

### 5. Building
When building Commet, there are some additional command line arguments that must be used to configure the build.

**Required**
| **Argument** | **Valid Values**                                                          | **Description**                                                                                              |

| VERSION_TAG  | *                                                                         | Supply the current build version, to display app version                                                     |
| BUILD_DETAIL | *                                                                         | Can provide additional detail about the current build, for example if it was being built for Flatpak or Snap |

**Example:**

```bash
cd commet
flutter run --dart-define BUILD_MODE=debug --dart-define PLATFORM=linux
