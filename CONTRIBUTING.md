# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Commet!

We are open to most types of contributions, but for larger changes and new features, please discuss with maintainers before you begin working. This will allow us to guide you on any preferred implementation details, and ensures you don't spend your time working on something which may be moving in the wrong direction.

## Restrictions on Generative AI Usage

We expect and appreciate authentic engagement in our community.  

Do not post output from Large Language Models or similar generative AI as comments on GitHub, as such comments tend to be formulaic and low content.

If you use generative AI tools as an aid in developing code, ensure that you fully understand the proposed changes and can explain why they are the correct approach.

Make sure you have added value based on your personal competency to your contributions. Just taking some input, feeding it to an AI and posting the result is not of value to the project. We reserve the right to rigorously reject seemingly AI generated low-value contributions.

Maintainers may close issues and PRs that are not useful or productive, including those that are fully generated by AI. If a contributor repeatedly opens unproductive issues or PRs, they may be blocked.
